## <em> Description
Created this portfolio page to display some of my recent projects and provide some links so users can have access to me and contact me with any questions or conerns they might have. I linked my Github account so users can visit and view my repositories and even add more content to any of my posted repositories. I have also linked my LinkedIn so users and potential employeers can contact me thru LinkedIn or for networking purposes as well. My resume and email address have also been displayed within my portfolio.
